This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Prerequisites

You must have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed in order to use npm. Recommended version is v16.x

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Ion tests

Ion tests are at pages/test1.tsx and pages/test2.tsx

View these pages when the server is running at http://localhost:3000/test1 and http://localhost:3000/test2

You will see that no content displays on either of these test pages, or, if it does, it disappears with a single simple refresh of the page.
